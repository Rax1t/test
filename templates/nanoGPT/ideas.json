        "Experiment": "Modify the Block class in model.py to include a convolutional layer after the attention layer. Implement a new ConvBlock class that incorporates the Bytenet decoder's convolutional structure. Add a 'conv_block' parameter to the GPTConfig class to toggle between the standard Block and the new ConvBlock. Update the GPT class to use ConvBlock when conv_block is True. Compare training speed, convergence, and performance metrics (perplexity, validation loss) between the modified model and the baseline across different datasets and model sizes.",
