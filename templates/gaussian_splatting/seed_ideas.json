        "Experiment": "Implement a dynamic sampling strategy within the Gaussian Splatting framework. During training, analyze the scene complexity in real-time using metrics such as gradient magnitude and local variance. Adjust the number of Gaussians allocated to different regions of the scene based on these metrics. More Gaussians will be allocated to regions with high complexity, while simpler regions will receive fewer Gaussians. This will involve modifying the densification and pruning mechanisms to incorporate real-time complexity analysis. Evaluate the impact on training time, resource utilization, and output quality by comparing against the baseline method.",

        "Experiment": "Modify the loss function in the training loop to include an importance weighting scheme. This scheme will assign higher weights to regions in the rendered image that are perceptually more important, such as areas with high edge density or high contrast. The importance map can be generated using simple image processing techniques like edge detection or contrast analysis. The modified loss function will then be used to guide the optimization of Gaussian parameters. Evaluate the impact on training time, output quality, and perceptual fidelity by comparing against the baseline method. Additionally, analyze the distribution of Gaussian blobs in the scene to ensure that they are more concentrated in important regions.",
