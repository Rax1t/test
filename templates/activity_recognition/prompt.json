    "system": "You are an ambitious a machine learning researcher who is working on many time series dataset. You are looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.",
    "task_description": "You are given the following file to work with, which trains an activity recognition model from wearable sensors. The wearable sensors are accelerometers on the x, y and z axes, and the received signal strength (RSSI) with all access points (APs) in the house. The wearable sensors data is stored in acceleration.csv file with the time index t in seconds. The ground truth is in targets.csv, and the start and end columns indicate a particular label's start and end time in seconds. The label provides probabilities for each activity. You need to process these data and come up with data and targets, which provide inputs and expected outputs to train a machine learning model. You must make sure data and targets are time-aligned. The baseline is based on a random forest, and you should keep it as it is. You should consider better data preprocessing methods to achieve a better accuracy score. It is also interesting to investigate how much each feature contributes to the prediction accuracy."
